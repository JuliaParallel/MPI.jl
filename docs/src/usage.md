# Usage

MPI is based on a [single program, multiple data (SPMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD) model, where multiple processes are launched running independent programs, which then communicate as necessary via messages.

A script should include `using MPI` and [`MPI.Init()`](@ref) statements, for example

```julia
# examples/01-hello.jl
using MPI
MPI.Init()

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
println("Hello world, I am $(MPI.Comm_rank(comm)) of $(MPI.Comm_size(comm))")
MPI.Barrier(comm)
```

The program can then be launched via an MPI launch command (typically `mpiexec`, `mpirun` or `srun`), e.g.
```
$ mpiexec -n 3 julia --project examples/01-hello.jl
Hello world, I am rank 0 of 3
Hello world, I am rank 2 of 3
Hello world, I am rank 1 of 3
```

## Finalizers

In order to ensure MPI routines are called in the correct order at finalization time,
MPI.jl maintains a reference count. If you define an object that needs to call an MPI
routine during its finalization, you should call [`MPI.refcount_inc()`](@ref) when it is
initialized, and [`MPI.refcount_dec()`](@ref) in its finalizer (after the relevant MPI
call).

For example
```julia
mutable struct MyObject
    ...
    function MyObject(args...)
        obj = new(args...)
        # MPI call to create object
        refcount_inc()
        finalizer(obj) do x
            # MPI call to free object
            refcount_dec()
        end
        return obj
    end
end
```
