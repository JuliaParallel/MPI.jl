# Known issues

## Julia module precompilation

If multiple MPI ranks trigger Julia's module precompilation, then a race condition can result in an error such as:
```
ERROR: LoadError: IOError: mkdir: file already exists (EEXIST)
Stacktrace:
 [1] uv_error at ./libuv.jl:97 [inlined]
 [2] mkdir(::String; mode::UInt16) at ./file.jl:177
 [3] mkpath(::String; mode::UInt16) at ./file.jl:227
 [4] mkpath at ./file.jl:222 [inlined]
 [5] compilecache_path(::Base.PkgId) at ./loading.jl:1210
 [6] compilecache(::Base.PkgId, ::String) at ./loading.jl:1240
 [7] _require(::Base.PkgId) at ./loading.jl:1029
 [8] require(::Base.PkgId) at ./loading.jl:927
 [9] require(::Module, ::Symbol) at ./loading.jl:922
 [10] include(::Module, ::String) at ./Base.jl:377
 [11] exec_options(::Base.JLOptions) at ./client.jl:288
 [12] _start() at ./client.jl:484
```

See [julia issue #30174](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/30174) for more discussion of this problem. There are similar issues with Pkg operations, see [Pkg issue #1219](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/1219).

This can be worked around be either:

1. Triggering precompilation before launching MPI processes, for example:

   ```
   julia --project -e 'using Pkg; pkg"instantiate"'
   julia --project -e 'using Pkg; pkg"precompile"'
   mpiexec julia --project script.jl
   ```

2. Launching julia with the  `--compiled-modules=no` option. This can result in much longer package load times.

## Open MPI

### Segmentation fault when loading the library

When attempting to use a system-provided Open MPI implementation, you may encounter a segmentation fault upon loading the library, or whenever the value of an environment variable is requested.
This can be fixed by setting the environment variable `ZES_ENABLE_SYSMAN=1`.
See [Open MPI issue #10142](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/10142) for more details.

### Segmentation fault in HCOLL

If Open MPI was built with support for HCOLL, you may encounter a segmentation fault in certain operations involving custom datatypes.
The stacktrace may look something like

```
hcoll_create_mpi_type at /opt/mellanox/hcoll/lib/libhcoll.so.1 (unknown line)
ompi_dtype_2_hcoll_dtype at /lustre/software/openmpi/llvm14/4.1.4/lib/openmpi/mca_coll_hcoll.so (unknown line)
mca_coll_hcoll_allgather at /lustre/software/openmpi/llvm14/4.1.4/lib/openmpi/mca_coll_hcoll.so (unknown line)
MPI_Allgather at /lustre/software/openmpi/llvm14/4.1.4/lib/libmpi.so (unknown line)
```

This is due to a bug in HCOLL, see [Open MPI issue #11201](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/11201) for more details.
You can disable HCOLL by exporting the environment variable

```sh
export OMPI_MCA_coll_hcoll_enable="0"
```

before starting the MPI process.

## MPICH

### `gethostbyname` failure in `internal_Init_thread`

When your internal network stack/route is not correctly configured for the local loopback device, MPICH may fail to initialize with an error message which looks like the following:

```
Fatal error in internal_Init_thread: Other MPI error, error stack:
internal_Init_thread(67)...........: MPI_Init_thread(argc=0x0, argv=0x0, required=2, provided=0x16db94160) failed
MPII_Init_thread(234)..............:
MPID_Init(67)......................:
init_world(171)....................: channel initialization failed
MPIDI_CH3_Init(84).................:
MPID_nem_init(314).................:
MPID_nem_tcp_init(175).............:
MPID_nem_tcp_get_business_card(397):
GetSockInterfaceAddr(370)..........: gethostbyname failed, bogon (errno 0)
```

A workaround is provided in the [documentation of the MOOSE framework](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/troubleshooting.html) and we report it here for reference:

* obtain your hostname
  ```console
  $ hostname
  mycoolname
  ```
* for both Linux and macOS systems, in your `/etc/hosts` file map the hostname you obtained at the previous step to the [localhost address `127.0.0.1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost), if not already present.
  _**Note**_: this step requires root access, to modify the system configuration file `/etc/hosts`, if you don't have it talk to your system administrator.
  For example, open the file `/etc/hosts` with `sudo` access with your favorite text editor (e.g. `sudo vi /etc/hosts`, or `sudo emacs /etc/hosts`) and add the line
  ```
  127.0.0.1  mycoolname
  ```
  to the end of the file
* as an alternative to the previous step, only for macOS systems, run the command
  ```
  sudo scutil --set HostName mycoolname
  ```
  However it has been reported that this method may not always be effective.

## UCX

[UCX](https://openucx.org/) is a communication framework used by several MPI implementations.

### Memory cache

When used with CUDA, UCX intercepts `cudaMalloc` so it can determine whether the pointer passed to MPI is on the host (main memory) or the device (GPU). Unfortunately, there are several known issues with how this works with Julia:
- [UCX issue #5061](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/issues/5061)
- [UCX issue #4001](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/issues/4001) (fixed in UCX v1.7.0)

By default, MPI.jl disables this by setting
```
ENV["UCX_MEMTYPE_CACHE"] = "no"
```
at `__init__` which may result in reduced performance, especially for smaller messages.

### Multi-threading and signal handling

When using [Julia multi-threading](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/#man-multithreading-1), the Julia garbage collector internally [uses `SIGSEGV` to synchronize threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/debuggingtips/#Dealing-with-signals-1).

By default, UCX will error if this signal is raised ([#337](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/337)), resulting in a message such as:
```
Caught signal 11 (Segmentation fault: invalid permissions for mapped object at address 0xXXXXXXXX)
```

This signal interception can be controlled by setting the environment variable `UCX_ERROR_SIGNALS`: if not already defined, MPI.jl will set it as:
```
ENV["UCX_ERROR_SIGNALS"] = "SIGILL,SIGBUS,SIGFPE"
```
at `__init__`. If set externally, it should be modified to exclude `SIGSEGV` from the list.
Note that in some cases even if `UCX_ERROR_SIGNALS` is not set explicitly, UCX might still take SIGSEGV as an error signal. In this case, it might be needed to explicitly set `UCX_ERROR_SIGNALS` with
```
export UCX_ERROR_SIGNALS="SIGILL,SIGBUS,SIGFPE"
```
before calling `mpiexec`.

## CUDA-aware MPI

### Memory pool

Using CUDA-aware MPI on multi-GPU nodes with recent CUDA.jl may trigger (see [here](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/1053#issue-946826096))
```
The call to cuIpcGetMemHandle failed. This means the GPU RDMA protocol
cannot be used.
  cuIpcGetMemHandle return value:   1
```
in the MPI layer, or fail on a segmentation fault (see [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/cuda-aware-mpi-works-on-system-but-not-for-julia/75060)) with
```
[1642930332.032032] [gcn19:4087661:0] gdr_copy_md.c:122 UCX ERROR gdr_pin_buffer failed. length :65536 ret:22
```
This is due to the MPI implementation using legacy `cuIpc*` APIs, which are incompatible with stream-ordered allocator, now default in CUDA.jl, see [UCX issue #7110](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/issues/7110).

To circumvent this, one has to ensure the CUDA memory pool to be set to `none`:
```
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
```
_More about CUDA.jl [memory environment-variables](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/memory/#Memory-pool)._

### Hints to ensure CUDA-aware MPI to be functional

Make sure to:
- Have MPI and CUDA on path (or module loaded) that were used to build the CUDA-aware MPI
- Set the following environment variables:
    ```
    export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
    export JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER=false
    ```
- Add CUDA, MPIPreferences, and MPI packages in Julia. Switch to using the system binary
  ```
  julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["CUDA", "MPIPreferences", "MPI"]); using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary()'
  ```
- Then in Julia, upon loading MPI and CUDA modules, you can check
  - CUDA version: `CUDA.versioninfo()`
  - If MPI has CUDA: [`MPI.has_cuda()`](@ref)
  - If you are using correct MPI library: `MPI.libmpi`

After that, it may be preferred to run the Julia MPI script (as suggested [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/cuda-aware-mpi-works-on-system-but-not-for-julia/75060/11)) launching it from a shell script (as suggested [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/cuda-aware-mpi-works-on-system-but-not-for-julia/75060/4)).

## ROCm-aware MPI

### Hints to ensure ROCm-aware MPI to be functional

Make sure to:
- Have MPI and ROCm on path (or module loaded) that were used to build the ROCm-aware MPI
- Add AMDGPU, MPIPreferences, and MPI packages in Julia:
  ```
  julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["AMDGPU", "MPIPreferences", "MPI"]); using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary()'
  ```
- Then in Julia, upon loading MPI and CUDA modules, you can check
  - AMDGPU version: `AMDGPU.versioninfo()`
  - If MPI has ROCm: [`MPI.has_rocm()`](@ref)
  - If you are using correct MPI implementation: `MPI.identify_implementation()`

After that, [this script](https://gist.github.com/luraess/c228ec08629737888a18c6a1e397643c) can be used to verify if ROCm-aware MPI is functional (modified after the CUDA-aware version from [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/cuda-aware-mpi-works-on-system-but-not-for-julia/75060/11)). It may be preferred to run the Julia ROCm-aware MPI script launching it from a shell script (as suggested [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/cuda-aware-mpi-works-on-system-but-not-for-julia/75060/4)).

## Custom reduction operators

It is not possible to use custom reduction operators [with 32-bit Microsoft MPI](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/246) on Windows and on [ARM CPUs](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/404) with any operating system.
These issues are due to due how custom operators are currently implemented in MPI.jl, that is by using [closure cfunctions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/index.html#Closure-cfunctions).
However they have two limitations:

* [Julia's C-compatible function pointers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/index.html#Creating-C-Compatible-Julia-Function-Pointers-1) cannot be used where the `stdcall` calling convention is expected, which is the case for 32-bit Microsoft MPI,
* closure cfunctions in Julia are based on LLVM trampolines, which are not supported on ARM architecture.

As an alternative [`MPI.@RegisterOp`](@ref) may be used to statically register reduction operations.
